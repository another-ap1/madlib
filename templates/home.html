    <h1>Create a Madlib</h1>
    <p>
        Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game created by Leonard Stern
        and Roger Price. It consists of one player prompting others for a 
        list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading 
        aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.
